# 🌐 WEB_DEV

This repository contains my web development projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a collection of practice projects, mini-websites, and components developed while learning and exploring front-end development.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder for easy access and maintenance. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `style.css` – Stylesheet for layout and design
- `script.js` – JavaScript file for interactivity (if applicable)
- `assets/` – Folder for images, fonts, or other assets (if any)

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For page structure
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout (including Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design)
- **JavaScript** – For interactivity and DOM manipulation



## 📌 Goals

- Improve front-end development skills
- Build responsive and accessible UIs
- Practice reusable components and clean code
- Document and track progress
